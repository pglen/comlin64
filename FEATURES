                               FEATURES
                               
 ComLin contains all the features of a full Linux installation. Text editors,
Web Browsers, Compilers, Email Clients, Graphical authoring Tools, Security
tools and utilities. In fact, ComLin can be used to publish a new version of
ComLin.
                                
Runlevel-Less operation

    To boot faster, and exclude unneeded baggage present on a full system,
    ComLin Linux operates without the distinction of runlevels. The system
    instead, cycles through a set of shell scripts.
    To aid troubleshooting, checkpoints are introduced, and one can press
    the ENTER key to temporarily drop to a shell prompt. Exiting the temporary
    shell will continue the boot process from the point of interruption.

Installation-Less operation

    ComLin Linux should operate on most every hardware combination supported
    by Linux. As of this writing, there are more then 3000+ different hardware
    drivers / items supported. ComLin Linux detects hardware by reading the
    system buses, and loading the drivers on the fly. Thanks to modern
    hardware, the identification / driver loading is fast. The system boots
    about the same speed or faster as a regular hard drive boot. ComLin works 
    right out of the box without installation on most every PC.

Special added Utilities

    Some additional utils where necessary, and some existing utilities had
    insufficient functionality. For example the 'getkey' utility did not work
    correctly on the boot terminal. Hence, new utility was called upon, and
    written that is simpler, and works on broken terminals. (Like the
    initial boot terminal) We aptly named the utility 'keyget'. For a full
    list of added utils see the source in ./apps directory.

Security Measures:

    The files in the project are protected by an sha1 sum. The sums are stored
    in the file "sha1.sum". The sum file is protected by the file SUMFILE.
    Make sure the SUMFILE signature checks out as well. If you want to,
    obtain a sum file from a  different source to make sure it is not
    tempered with. (for example: the project page).
    Executing ./checksum.sh should verify the project's integrity. Note that
    the sum files themselves are not verifiable without the external
    second verifyer. (chicken and egg conundrum) Hence the redirection to
    get a sum file (or sum file sum) from different (not tempered) source.

Data Security and Privacy Measures:

    ComLin has an encrypted subsystem, that is controllable from the padlock
    icon on the top panel. Click on the padlock icon, and select the
    encrypted folder you wish to activate. You will be prompted for a
    password, and the folder will become accessible. You may copy/save
    any file in the encrypted folder,  it will be automatically encrypted.
    The initial password is '1234' for the stock encrypted folder,
    make sure you change it before deployment.
