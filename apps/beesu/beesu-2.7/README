------------------------------------ BEESU -------------------------------------

Beesu is a wrapper around su and it works with consolehelper under
Fedora to let you have a graphic interface like gksu.

It's useful to replace the missing gksu in Fedora.

It's a simple software, but once installed, you could read its
manual by typing `man beesu'.
