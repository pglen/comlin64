                            SECURITY

The initial boot setup contains the following user accounts:

    'root'  pass is 'root'
    'user'  pass is 'user'
    'guest' pass is 'guest' The guest user does Not have admin rights.

Note:
    The entries are meant to be used without the quotes. ('user' = user)

The following are optional,

    The encryption pass is '12345678' (without the quotes)
    The keychain pass is '12345678' (without the quotes)

    Make sure you change these passwords on first successful WRITABLE boot.

Security caution / warning:

    If you can, boot first without a network cable attached, and change the
    passes before connecting to a network.

    If you can, boot first without entering the WIFI password or your WIFI
    turned off, and change the passes before connecting to a network.

    Pass changing shortcuts are placed on the initial desktop for your
    convenience.

    Initially, the network is firewalled, with only some standard ports open.
	(HTTP, SSH ...) You may enable more firewalled ports by editing the
	firewall configuration.

 Just in case one considers improving / heighteninig security, the
following information may be useful.

### List of user suid files:

    /bin/su
    /bin/passwd
    /usr/libexec/polkit-agent-helper-1
    /usr/bin/sudo
    /usr/bin/setsid
    /usr/bin/chvt
    /usr/lib/xorg/Xorg    ,
    /usr/lib/dbus-1.0/dbus-daemon-launch-helper
    /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/xfce4/session/xfsm-shutdown-helper

### List of group suid files:

    /usr/libexec/camel-lock-helper-1.2
    /usr/bin/plocate
    /usr/bin/setsid

 These files are suid, because that is needed for the proper operations
and configuration of te system. Once that is done, most items can be un sudo-d.
    (like: chmod ug-s filename)
