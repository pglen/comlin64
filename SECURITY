    The initial setup contains two user accounts: 'root' and 'user'
    
        'root' pass is 'admin1234' (without the quotes)
        'user' pass is 'user1234' (without the quotes)
        
    The encryption pass is '1234' (without the quotes)
    The keychain pass is '1234' (without the quotes)

    Make sure you change these passwords on first successful boot.

    If you can, boot first without a network cable attached, and change the
    passes before connecting to a network.

    If you can, boot first without entering the WIFI password or your WIFI 
    turned off, and change the passes before connecting to a network.
    
    Pass changing shortcuts are placed on the desktop for your convenience.
    
    Initially, the network is firewalled, with only some standard ports open.
	(HTTP, SSH ...) You may enable more firewalled ports by editing the
	firewall configuration.
