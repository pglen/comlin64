                               QUICKSTART

  If you downloaded the comlin_image64_xxx.tgz, unzip it to your hard drive.

Make ISO:
	
	Execute 'make buildiso'
	Done.

 The text below originated from the 32 bit system. Please wait for updates,
or use it as a 'rough' guide on what to do.

Make USB:

	Insert your 16(+)GB jump drive, and make note of its device.
	(use 'df' or 'mount') Execute the dd utility to duplicate the disk image 
	onto your jump drive.

                               Warning!
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    These instructions contain disk formatting and disk image creation 
    operations.  It is the  responsibility of the  user (means you) to 
    use these instructions with care. Misuse of these instructions may 
                   destroy data. You have been warned.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
        
 Assuming comlin version is 'xxx' and jump drive device is '/dev/sdd' issue 
the command:

      sudo dd if=comlin-image64-xxx of=/dev/sdd

  If you downloaded the comlin-xxx.tgz, unzip it to your hard drive. Make
sure you unzip as root or as sudo, so the extraction preserves permissions.
(suids) Change to the newly created  directory.
(comlin/comlin-xxx [xxx being the version of the project])

 Type 'make detect' (without the quotes), and follow the prompts. You may
need to insert your new jump drive in response to the prompts. The script
will establish which device is your USB jump drive.

                ***********************************
                
 Anything further formats drives, partitions etc .. exercise due care.

                ***********************************

  Type 'make new' to  partition and format the USB jump drive. When finished,
the script will prompt you to remove and reinsert the jump drive.

  Type 'make copyusb' to copy the Linux system files onto the jump drive. May
take some time to shift several gigs of data. (Remember, it is a complete
system.) [see Timings section for details]) When ready, type 'make syslin'
to install the bootable parts.

  Finally, type 'make unmount' and your jump drive is ready.

  To boot a computer from a jump drive, set the BIOS for 'USB DOS'/ Emulation,
and set the 'Boot Device' to the USB drive. (Different BIOS-es use different
wordings, so follow the instructions above loosely)

 Congratulations, you now have a low cost solid state computer, that works at
the same speed as a hard drive installation. (or faster) The USB drive is
safe to use in any computer, as it does not mount anyhing without explicit
request. It does however auto mount inserted removables. (CD, DVD, USB, FW)

 For the really impatient, type:

  make detect  (and follow the propts)
  su root -c "make doall"

 Optionally, you can order a ready made jump drive.
See the SourceForge project page for details.

 Timings:  (on a 3GHz AMD K8)

 Unpacking the archive will run about 9 minutes
 Creating the jump drive will run about 31 Minutes

To create a new distro:

    The pack.sh script will run about 17 minutes
    The 'make getusb' will run about 30 minutes
    (Timings above where mesured with a 3Ghz AMD 1.5 Gig RAM)
