                     The BUILD and SYSTEM Options

 This was inherited from the ancestor project ... mostly true for COMLIN. Notable
exceptions is that COMLIN does not download or update anything while in operation. 

 See the actual config files for more info.

    a.) config_build file

        Configure here everything related to the building process.
    
    b.) config_drive file
    
        The USB drive you are working with. Use 'make detect' to create it.
        see config_drive.sample for the format of the file

    c.) config_system file

        Configure here everything related to the actual system. Most of these
        settings are ignored, edit the actual files in the ../comlin-usb-xxx 
        subdirectory or on the host system.
