                     The BUILD and SYSTEM Options

 The system options were inherited from the ancestor project ... mostly. 
Notable exceptions is that COMLIN64 does not download or update anything 
while creating ISOs or USBs.

 See the actual config files for more info.

    a.) config_build file

        Configure here everything related to the building process.
    
    b.) config_drive file
    
        The USB drive you are working with. Use 'make detect' to create it.
        see the file config_drive.sample for the format of the file

    c.) config_system file

        Configure here everything related to the actual system. Most of these
        settings are ignored, or used as defaults. Edit the actual files in 
		the ../comlin64-usb-xxx subdirectory. (or on the host system if 
		applicable)
