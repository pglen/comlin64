# Most of the items below are obsolete, kept in for reference

# the bootloader you want to use
# it can be one of "isolinux", "lilo", "syslinux" or "grub"
# i suggest using isolinux because you can make the
# kernel and the initrd as big as you like. if you use
# syslinux, lilo or grub the size of your kernel image
# and the compressed initrd should not exceed 2.88MB.
# lilo/syslinux/grub may or may not run on systems
# where isolinux does not work

# The size of the initial ramdisk in kbytes
RAMSIZE="14000"

# Must be multiple of 0x8000
#RAMSIZE=$((400*0x8000))

# If you don't want to burn the cd but only the isoimage say yes here
# you will find the image in $BASE/rescuecd.iso

ISOIMAGEONLY="yes"

#ISOIMAGEONLY="no"

# if you want to use a compressed ISO9660 image say yes here. It
# will double the available space on your cd.
# if you plan to load the rescuecd into ram then i highly suggest
# using a compressed is9660 fs because it will reduce the
# total needed RAM by the factor 2.
# Be sure to read doc/README.compressedfs before setting this
# switch to yes.

COMPRESSEDFS="no"

# if you want to use a compressed cramfs image say yes here. It
# will double the available space on your cd. cramfs will
# result in a slightly better compression ratio than zisofs, but
# on the other hand cramfs is somewhat limited. Max. 256MB Images
# and max. 16MB big files are supported.
# if you plan to load the rescuecd into ram then i highly suggest
# using a compressed cramfs image because it will reduce the
# total needed RAM by the factor 2.
# The kernel will need compiled in support for cramfs.
# Only one of COMPRESSEDFS and CRAMFS can be set to yes.

# size of the floppy disk image if you are using lilo, syslinux or grub as the
# bootloader.
# usually you won't change this except your bios only boots from 1.44MB
# floppy disk images, which is rather unusual.
# if you want a real bootable floppy disk use the script utils/make_boot_disk.
# possible values are 144 for an 1.44MB disk image and 288 for an 2.88MB
# disk image.
# the following combinations will not work with the default configuration:
# - 144 and grub
# - 144 and lilo
# you probably need to build your own kernel if you are constrained to
# use 1.44MB floppy images (except isolinux of course, which does not need
# any floppy images).
